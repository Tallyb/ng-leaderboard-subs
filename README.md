# ng-leaderboard-subs
Mutliple subscriptions with ng-angular http://ng-leaderboard-subs2.meteor.com/

so what is in here? 
This is an explanation on how meteor handles multiple subscriptions to the same collection (Players); 
There are 3 subscriptions. You can start and stop any of them individually. 

You will see 2 queries from the local collection: 
- All of the items in the collection
- The top 2 players (by score) from the collection

The source was updated to the changes made in angular-meteor 1.3. You can check the 1.2 tag to see previous code.
